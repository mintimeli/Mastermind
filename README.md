# Mastermind

This is my first C# application!
This is a simplified version of the Mastermind game. The game will randomly generate a 4-digit answer and your goal is to find that answer.
The answer will only contain numbers 1 to 6. For every correct number in the correct position, a plus (+) will appear below the number,
and for every correct number in the wrong position, a minus (-) sign will appear below that number.
You have 10 attempts to find the answer. Best of luck!
